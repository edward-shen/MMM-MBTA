![Example of MMM-MBTA](./example_picture.png)

This [MagicMirror²][mm] Module is designed to pull information from the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority's API and to show and filter data.

For this to work, you need to create your own MBTA API key. You can get one by following [this link][mbta dev portal] and 
signing up. Note that it may take up to a day to approve your api key, according to their website.

**DISCLAIMER**

The times provided are from MBTA's API. As a result, the predicted values may be off. Please only use this as an estimation. I am not responsible for missed transportation and any consequences as a result of it. This is not a precise tool, nor have I claimed it to be. By using this module, you agree to never assume that this is a precise tool, and that I take no fault in any missed appointments, finals, etc.

## Installation

In your terminal, go to your MagicMirror's Module folder:

```bash
cd ~/MagicMirror/modules
```
Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/edward-shen/MMM-MBTA.git
```
Configure the module in your config.js file.

## Using the module

To use this module, add it to the modules array in the `config/config.js` file:
```js
modules: [
    {
        module: 'MMM-MBTA',
        position: 'top_right', // This can be any of the regions.
        header: "MBTA:",
        config: {
            apikey: 'your_api_key',
        }
    }
]
```

## Configuration options

Option|Description
------|-----------
`apikey`|Api key given by the MBTA.<br/>**Expected Value type:** `String`.
`updateInterval`|Time between updates, in seconds. To protect API abuse, this module automatically limits this value to a minimum of `10`.<br/>**Expected Value type:** `int`.
`baseUrl`|The base url of the MBTA api. You shouldn't change this unless the MBTA moved the api to the new location, and the update hasn't been reflected in this module.<br/>**Expected Value type:** `String`.
`stations`|This is an array of stations that you wish to display. Currently, only one max station is allowed. Find station names at https://www.mbta.com/stops/subway. Make sure to use the common name!<br/>Example: `stations: [ "Airport" ]`.<br/>**Expected Value type:** `[String, String, ...]`.
`predictedTimes`|Use MBTA predicted times or scheduled times. Default is predicted times (true).<br/>**Expected Value type:** `boolean`.
`doAnimation`|Whether or not to do an animation when updating.<br/>**Expected Value type:** `boolean`.
`animationSpeed`|How long the update animation lasts. <br/>**Expected Value type:** `int`.
`formatETA`|Show ETA time in MM:SS instead of just seconds.<br/>**Expected Value type:** `boolean`.
`showMinutesOnly`|Show ETA time in minutes only. This overrides `formatETA`.<br/>**Expected Value type:** `boolean`.
`showOnly`|Filter out various modes of transportation. Example: `showOnly: ["Subway"]` would only show subways, while `showOnly: ["Subway", "Bus"]` would show both subways and buses. Default is to show all modes of transportation.<br/>**Expected Value type:** `[String, String, ...]`.<br/>The various options are `Subway`, `Train`, `Bus`, `Ferry`, `Cable car`.
`maxEntries`|The maximum entries allowed. Default is `8`.<br/>**Expected Value type:** `int`.
`maxTime`|The maximum ETA time the modules should list, in minutes. Default is to show all. <br/>**Expected Value type:** `int`.
`showArrivalTime`|Show MBTA's predicted arrival time of the transportation vehicle.<br/>**Expected Value type:** `boolean`.
`showDepartTime`|Show MBTA's predicted departure time of the transportation vehicle.<br/>**Expected Value type:** `boolean`.
`showETATime`|Show MBTA's predicted ETA for the vehicle.<br/>**Expected Value type:** `boolean`.
`fade`|Whether or not to fade the module.<br/>**Expected Value type:** `boolean`.
`fadePoint`|At what point to start fading. <br/>**Expected Value type:** `float`. Value range is from 0 to 1.
`showFullName`|Display the full name instead of the short name. Due to the length the text, it is strongly recommended that the postition of this module is set to `top_bar`, `bottom_bar`, or any location where it can expand to the entire width when this is set to `true`.<br/>**Expected Value type:** `boolean`.
`colorIcons`|Display the vehicle icons in their respective color.<br/>**Expected Value type:** `boolean`.
`showAlerts`|Shows alerts near the specified station.<br/>**Expected Value type:** `boolean`.<br/>**WARNING**: Alerts are only properly shown when in a full-width position, such as `top_bar`, `middle_center` or `lower_third`.
`hideEmptyAlerts`|Automatically hide the alerts section when there are no alerts.<br/>**Expected Value type:** `boolean`.
`direction`| Sets the default direction you care about.<br/>Example: `direction:  "Inbound" `.<br/>**Expected Value type:** `String`.
`flipDirection`| When set to `true`, MMM-MBTA will the flip the direction filter for incoming vehicles at the station, i.e. Inbound in the AM and Outbound in PM<br/>**Expected Value type:** `boolean`.
`flipHour`| Specifies the hour to flip the direction, if `flipDirection` is equal to `true`. Default value is 12.<br/>**Expected Value type:** `int`.
`noETAToBack` | Favor entries with an ETA, hiding entries without ETAs if possible.<br/>**Expected Value type:** `boolean`.
`showDirection` | Show "In" or "Out".<br/>**Expected Value type:** `false`.

More options will be added as this module becomes feature-rich.

## Planned Features
- [x] Alert tickers **Partial support**
- [x] Filter displayed trips by direction (i.e. Northbound, Eastbound)
- [ ] ETA countdown when vehicle is close to arriving
- [ ] Time filter to display certain trips during specified times of the day

## Known Bugs
- Gondola and funicular icons are unsupported!

  This is intentional. Unless there's a Font Awesome icon, or one that resembles one, I'm not adding it in, because there shouldn't be gondolas and funiculars in Boston anyways.

- The header disappears when you fade the rest out! What gives?

  Unfortunately, that's due to an issue with MagicMirror² core. I may do a pull request in the future, but as of right now, this is (unfortunate) intented behavior.

- Using Scheduled times instead of predicted times.
